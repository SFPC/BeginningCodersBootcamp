- TODO: solution to the generalized letter function

- fix tense across files (present tense, 1st person plural for general narrative)
- move stuff around to make days more even
    - move function stuff from day 1 to day 2
    - move end of day 2 to day 3
- divide content up into "instruction", "exercises" and "homework"
- incorporate robby's code examples into instruction
    - 04-functions-intro introduces setup before parameters, but in lecture notes, this is flipped around. parameterized function is introed at end of day 1, where as setup is introed day 2.
    - probably should just remove 04-functions-intro?

- add "daily cheat sheet" to each day
