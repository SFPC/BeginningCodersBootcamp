10/next
- day 3:
    - finish up "Writing a function with input and output" example
    - figure out exercises


10/6
- day 3:
    - "Functions that return values"    - mostly remove this, but keep some language for below
    - "Math functions in C++"           - talk about returns, create table of math functions
    - "Writing a function with input and output" — example with distance function

- translations now covered in day 1, remove from day 4
- motivate day 2 "Parameters" better
    - maybe should change width / height of letter?

- generate table of contents for everything
    - look at balance of exercises

day 1: draw a scene
    functions and translations
day 2: bouncing ball
    draw loop, member variables, boolean, if statement
day 3: rain / letter loop / stars?
    objects (ofPoint), functions with parameters and returns

    - need to motivate parameters
    - need to motivate returns
    - homework assignment should naturally require writing your own function

day 4: 3d scene
    3d graphics, transformations, rotations


- robby conversation
    - more variable examples in day 1
    - more expressions in day 1
    - random?

- move stuff around to make days more even
    - move function stuff from day 1 to day 2
    - move end of day 2 to day 3
- divide content up into "instruction", "exercises" and "homework"
- incorporate robby's code examples into instruction
    - 04-functions-intro introduces setup before parameters, but in lecture notes, this is flipped around. parameterized function is introed at end of day 1, where as setup is introed day 2.
    - probably should just remove 04-functions-intro?

- add "daily cheat sheet" to each day
- is "else" or "else if" used anywhere?

- day 1
