# Pre-class work

Before the first day of class, students should try installing both an *IDE* and *openFrameworks*. IDE stands for "integrated development environment" and is what allows students to run programming code on your computer. openFrameworks is a coding library that students will be using extensively at SFPC. Here are specific instructions for Mac and Windows:

### Mac OSX
- Install [Xcode 10](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the app store. If you have an older version of Xcode already installed, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. 
- When installing Xcode, you may be prompted to update your operating system. We recommend you do this.
- Download and install [openFrameworks for Mac.](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- There are more details instructions [here](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/) to test your setup, you only need the first two sections: “First Steps” and “Testing your setup”. 
- We recommend you use the latest version of OF and Xcode. If this is not possible, just drop us an email and we will help you sort it out.

### Windows
- Install [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6278-visual-studio.html). Note that this is an older version of Visual Studio; please install this older version even if you have a newer version installed.
- Install [openFrameworks for Visual Studio.](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- More detailed setup guide is [here](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/). We will also be able to help you in class.

### Linux
- QT Creator is the officially supported IDE. [Here are instructions](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/qtcreator/) for working with QT creator. If you’re using a different IDE [start here.](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/)
- One request -- you'll need to install a compiler -- if you are on OSX, you should install xcode.  You can install this through the OSX app store (search for xcode). If you have an older version of OSX, it may ask you update the OS.  

Also, download openFrameworks for your given platform: http://openframeworks.cc/download/
