# Bootcamp 01 

open with a 20 minute talk about the goals of coding. what is code? [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LyL2s73L5CTtCaYfjDCRjG1mK-9FNm1_mgxFSXcamgQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## sketch 01: "name"

### A: explore

spend 10 minutes learning about and exploring open frameworks drawing functions like line, rect, circle, ellipse.

lessons:

- learn basic C++ syntax, like semicolons, case-sensitivity
- different parameters mean different things sometimes, x / width / radius
- there are conventions, x comes before y, width before height
- the computer reads your code top-down like we do.

come back together: what did we learn about basic C++ syntax?

- can you leave out the spaces between function parameters? **yes**
- can you put two commands on the same line? **yes, if you use semicolons**
- can you leave out arguments? **no**

### B: draw your name

comment out all your draw code. new goal: "draw your name". 20-30 minutes to work on this.

## sketch 02: "letter"

### A: repeat one letter

setup this sketch by copying and pasting your code for your **first letter only**.

challenge: draw this letter twice, right next to this one. 5-10 minutes

### B: variables

let's come back together and learn about variables. we have some slides. 20 minutes talk about the life cycle of variables.

revisit your code and make use of variables to your code.

**arithmetic** prepare your code so you see many copies of the same number. a translation in the x looks like adding `+ 300` to all your x values. what other arithmetic operations can the computer do?

challenge: make copies of your letter using variables.

### C: colors

this allows us to talk about painters algorithm (can't really demonstrate until colors). the last line of code is the thing on top.

play with colors in ofSetColor, and ofBackground. learn about how the state of the colors wraps around to the beginning of the draw loop.

ofFill and ofNoFill

## Homework

your homework is to learn about functions and convert your letter into a function. [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNc5wHwXPVM)
