School for Poetic Computation’s Bootcamp introduces the foundations of coding to beginners by creating visual art and animations in openFrameworks. This 5 day session will be open both to incoming SFPC students and anyone who wants to learn to code. 

During this week students will be coding in C++, learning concepts like variables, memory, and scope; branching, looping, boolean evaluations, and logic; functions, recursion, and events; object-oriented design; and working with media like video, sound, and responding to keyboard and mouse inputs. Students will become competent in Xcode/Visual Studio, GitHub, and openFrameworks.

## Schedule
### Day 1
- introduction to code as a medium for creation, different languages and their benefits.
- introduction to Xcode/VisualStudio, Github, the openFrameworks ecosystem, and the C++ build system.
- C++ code syntax, OpenGL coordinate system
- Processing, openFrameworks, Arduino design paradigm: setup() and draw()
- simple graphics drawing primitives
- introduction to variables, computer memory, types, scope, and functions.

## Day 2
- returning functions
- openFrameworks utility methods, random numbers, time, math
- principles of animation
- control structures: branching and looping
- event handlers: mouse and keyboard

## Day 3
- container data structures
- object-oriented design
- classes, methods, properties, and states
- ofPoint and other openFrameworks primitives

## Day 4
- more openFrameworks object types: polylines, vectors, cameras
- ofxAddons, community extensions to openFrameworks
- transformations
  - rotate, translate scale
  - push, pop matrices
- function recursion

## Day 5
- C++ standard library types
- reading and writing data
- displaying images, playing audio, capturing video
- classwork and examples in other programming languages
