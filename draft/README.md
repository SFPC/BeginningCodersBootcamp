# Creative Coding Bootcamp
A three week program to introduce the foundations of coding to beginners by creating visual art and animations in openFrameworks. This 5 course session will be open to anyone who wants to learn to code.

## [Season], [year], [Monday month xxxx] â€“ [Monday month xxxx]
Instructor:
Teaching Assistant:
Location: Zoom
Class Time: 
Office Hours: Approximately 3 hours of Teacher & TA support during the week based on student availability.

During this course students will be coding in C++ with openFrameworks, learning concepts like variables, memory, and scope; branching, looping, boolean evaluations, and logic; functions, recursion, and events; object-oriented design; OpenGl and 3D graphics, and working with media like video, sound, and responding to keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Before Class

**This is very important!** Before the first day of class, please get openFrameworks up and running. Debugging can sometimes take up to 30 minutes and we won't have time once class begins.

## Schedule

- [Day 1: Graphics, variables, functions](01/)
- [Day 2: Animations, ofMap](02/)
- [Day 3: Loops, arrays](03/)
- [Day 4: branching, classes, ofPoints/polyline/image, assets](04/)
- [Day 5: 3D, pixels, recursion](05/)

## Day 1

- Create and run openFrameworks projects
- Introduce basic C++ syntax
- Use openFrameworks graphics functions (`ofDrawLine`, `ofDrawCircle` etc.) in the `draw` loop
- Declare and assign primitive variables (`int`, `float`)
- Use variables to reduce redundancy
- styling in openFrameworks
- understand the painter's algorithm

video content

- Declare and define functions with parameters

## Day 2

- Use `ofRandom` to produce random numbers in various ranges
- Use `cout` to log values
- persistent variables using `ofApp.h` and `setup()`
- introduction to boolean expressions
- introduction to loops and making use of the `i` iterator inside the loop

video content

- arrays (c++ vector), how they can relate to each iteration of a loop.

## Day 3

- `ofMap()`, sine and cosine and `ofGetElapsedTimef()`
- if statements
- using variables to modify other variables (position-velocity)
- Using the openFrameworks `update` function
- uncover the need for a class, to encapsulate similar-objects.
- create our own particle class

video content

- c++ classes

## Day 4

- ofPoint, ofPolyline, ofPath
- functions that return
- type, fonts, and conversion to ofPath
- nested loops
- transformations, push / popMatrix

## Day 5

- 3D
- lighting
- nested transformations
- Perlin noise
- Keyboard input
- Using openFrameworks addons
