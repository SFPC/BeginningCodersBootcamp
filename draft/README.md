# Creative Coding Bootcamp

A three week program to introduce the foundations of coding to beginners by creating visual art and animations in openFrameworks. This 5 course session will be open to anyone who wants to learn to code.

During this course students will be coding in C++ with openFrameworks, learning concepts like variables, memory, and scope; branching, looping, boolean evaluations, and logic; functions, recursion, and events; object-oriented design; OpenGl and 3D graphics, and working with media like video, sound, and responding to keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Before Class

**This is very important!** Before the first day of class, please get openFrameworks up and running. Debugging can sometimes take up to 30 minutes and we won't have time once class begins.
