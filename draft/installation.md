# openFrameworks installation notes

Running openFrameworks requires you install both an IDE and openFrameworks. An IDE stands for "integrated development environment" and is what allows you to run programming code on your computer. openFrameworks is a coding library that you'll be using extensively at SFPC. Here are specific instructions for Mac and Windows:

### Mac OSX

- Install the latest version of Xcode [Xcode 11](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (or xcode 10) from the app store. If you have an older version of Xcode already installed, we recommend upgrading to the latest version.  You can also install multiple versions of xcode side by side if needed (see details [here](https://medium.com/@hacknicity/working-with-multiple-versions-of-xcode-e331c01aa6bc)).
- If you need to install earlier version of xcode (xcode 10 should work) because of your operating system, you can find them [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?q=xcode).  You will need a developer login for apple but don't need a paid developer account.  
- Download and install [openFrameworks for Mac.](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- There are more details instructions [here](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/) to test your setup, you only need the first two sections: “First Steps” and “Testing your setup”.
- We recommend you use the latest version of OF and Xcode. If this is not possible, just drop us an email and we will help you sort it out.
- Note that Xcode is fairly large, you should clear space on your hard drive if necessary.  If you run into any space issues, we recommend the free app [OmniDiskSweeper](https://www.omnigroup.com/more) to help see where you can gain/free space.

### Windows

- Install [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6278-visual-studio.html).  Choose the free community edition.   Once the installer loads, choose "Desktop development with C++" as what to install.  you don't need to choose any other option.  Note that this is an older version of Visual Studio.  You can work with 2019 if you have installed it for c++ development. 
- Microsoft may ask you to sign in with your mirosoft password.  You can make one if you need to. 
- If you have visual studio 2019 installed, you can update your projects when you load them to work with the newer tool as long as you have c++ installed and an appropriate SDK.  When you load a project, it will ask you to "retarget" it, which is updating it for 2019. 
- Install [openFrameworks for Visual Studio.](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- More detailed setup guide is [here](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/). We will also be able to help you in class.
- Once you have visual studio intall, a quick intro to openFrameworks on a PC is here [VIDEO](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2y2pvfmznknnayi/VS.mp4?dl=0)

### Linux

- QT Creator is the officially supported IDE. [Here are instructions](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/qtcreator/) for working with QT creator. If you're using a different IDE [start here.](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/)
